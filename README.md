# Quantitative Analysis of Manatee Mortality in Florida Waterways

The mortality of West Indian Manatees (Trichechus manatus) has been a concern since 1972
when manatees were listed as endangered. As a result, the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission and teams of partnering biologists began to collect data revolving the
mortality of manatees throughout Florida in 1974 (“Fish and Wildlife”). Deaths of manatees by
watercraft collision has accounted for over 20% of the deaths of manatees from 1974 to 2015.
Examining relationships between the anatomy of manatees, their size and sex, and the
environment surrounding the manatee, such as season or region, can help to bring call to factors
worth looking into further surrounding the unfortunate frequency in human related deaths for the
West Indian manatee. The data taken from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission is used in this analysis. The explanatory variables focused on in this study are the
size of deceased manatees, the sex of the manatee, the region that the manatees are found in, and
the season when the manatee was found. In order to explore a potential relationship a
Generalized Linear Modeling approach was used to determine any relationship between the
explanatory variables and the occurrence of Watercraft collision deaths in manatees. A
Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling(NMDS) analysis was used to help visualize potential
differences between groupings of manatees that died from collision and those that didn’t. The
results of the Generalized Linear Modeling analyses showed that there were not any independent
significant relationships of size, sex, region, and season with the occurrence of watercraft
collision death in the West Indian Manatee. The NMDS analyses resulted in visualizations that
suggested that there is not much evidence of a difference between manatees that die from
collision and those that do not.
